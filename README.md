## 💅🏾 The Official Nails by Tam Code

This is one of my very first big projects with multiple pages. It's a fully functional service website that informs viewers of services and allows them to purchase products via Shopify.
 **The shop page is commented out due to no longer being open**
 
 ## Home Page
 
Displays a carousel with PNG cutouts of products, multiple fonts, and customized icons created in illustrator to explain services.
**The testimonial section has to be the same length of characters in order to scroll with the same dimensiions**
The header is from Bootstrap for the clean designed hamburger menu.

## About & Policy Page

Uses the theme of header titles and fade ins to create more dynamic effects for text.

## Gallery Page

Uses flexbox to organize photos for different devices
